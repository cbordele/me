## Still working on the site
Wow it's been more than a week and I'm still updating this site!

## Test Game
Test game is very basic but working as intended. Some notes:
 - you can draw anything on the screen
 - up and down arrow grow and shrink the brush size (sorry mobile users)
 - the colors follow a pattern where each subsequent color should look relatively good compared to the last.

Here's some art I made

![Art I made]({{ '/assets/img/art.png' | relative_url }})

It could still use a better UI/image export feature etc. But don't plan to continue updating it for now

## Other Plans
If you notice the background of my linkedin, you can see an ascii representation of an image. I had created a python script for that but my plan is to convert it to a webapp and put that here. Maybe I'll add a little twist as well.

I've got some other ideas for some small webapps to put here. Also I'm always open to suggestions so hit me up


## Bonus
Had [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjBggIqkQ1E) stuck in my head all day today
