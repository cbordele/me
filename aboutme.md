My name is Carter Bordeleau. I'm currently working as a software engineer in the Bay Area. 

### My story

I grew up in Upstate New York and attended the University of Rochester, where I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my time there I met my amazing wife and made a lot of friends. It was also during this time that I discovered my passion for coding.

As I was looking for internships I discovered there was a lot more opportunity in the Software Engineering industry than Electrical or Computer Engineering, so my wife and I packed up and moved to San Francisco. Here I've made even more friends, found some great mentors, and (maybe most importantly) learned a lot - about engineering and myself.
